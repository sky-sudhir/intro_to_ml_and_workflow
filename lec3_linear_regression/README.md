## Analysis & Insights

### Most Important Features

Based on the correlation analysis and model coefficients, the most important features influencing `median_house_value` are:

- **median_income**: Strong positive correlation with house value.
- **total_rooms** and **total_bedrooms**: Indicate housing size and capacity, but may require normalization.
- **housing_median_age**: Older houses may have different values depending on location.
- **population_per_household**: Reflects density and living conditions.
- **ocean_proximity**: Encoded as dummy variables, proximity to the ocean impacts house prices.

### Model Limitations

- **Linear Assumptions**: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship, which may not capture complex patterns in housing data.
- **Feature Scaling**: While MinMax scaling is used, outliers can still affect model performance.
- **Missing Values**: Imputation strategies may introduce bias if not carefully chosen.
- **Multicollinearity**: Highly correlated features can distort coefficient interpretation and reduce model robustness.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting**: Ridge regression helps with regularization, but model selection and tuning are crucial.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features) to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Advanced Models**: Try tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for better performance and feature importance analysis.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize regularization parameters and model settings using grid search or randomized search.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers to improve model accuracy.
- **Geographical Features**: Incorporate spatial data or clustering to capture location-based effects more effectively.
